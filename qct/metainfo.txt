Title: pqc_demo.py — Post-Quantum Cryptography Risk Demonstration

Purpose:
This script is a pedagogical demonstration of how post-quantum attacks
(analogous to Shor’s algorithm) threaten elliptic-curve–based blockchain
systems once public keys are revealed on-chain or in the mempool.

It illustrates, end-to-end, how:
1) Funds are locked to an address derived from a hash of a public key.
2) Spending a transaction reveals the public key and signature.
3) An attacker capable of solving the elliptic curve discrete logarithm
   can recover the private key from the public key.
4) The attacker can forge a competing transaction and steal funds via a
   mempool race.

Scope and Limitations:
- This is NOT Bitcoin, Ethereum, or production cryptography.
- All elliptic curve parameters are intentionally tiny.
- The signature scheme is a toy Schnorr-like construction used solely
  to demonstrate “forge after key recovery.”
- Classical brute force is used to simulate the effect of Shor’s algorithm.

What This Demo Is:
- A conceptual and educational model
- A presentation-friendly illustration of PQC risk
- A tool for explaining why public-key exposure matters

What This Demo Is NOT:
- Secure cryptographic code
- A blockchain implementation
- A realistic performance or threat model

Key Insight:
The cryptographic breaking point in many ECC-based systems is not address
creation, but public-key revelation at spend time. Once ECC discrete log
is broken, signatures become forgeable and transaction authenticity
collapses.

Recommended Use:
- Educational demos
- Risk discussions for post-quantum migration
- Security architecture presentations
